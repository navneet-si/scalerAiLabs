Meeting Notes & Transcription Platform
(Fireflies.ai Clone)  —  SDE Fullstack Assignment
Description
Build a functional clone of the Fireflies.ai meeting-assistant web application that replicates its design, user experience, and core post-meeting workflows.
The platform should allow users to browse a library of meetings, view interactive transcripts with speaker labels and timestamps, read AI-generated summaries and action items, search across transcripts, and experience the clean, productivity-focused interface of the original Fireflies app.
Your implementation should visually and functionally feel like a modern Fireflies workspace. The focus is on recreating the Fireflies experience and core meeting/transcript workflows rather than performing real speech-to-text — transcription and AI summaries can be mocked, seeded, or generated from uploaded transcript files.
AI Tools Usage
You are allowed and encouraged to use AI tools such as ChatGPT, Claude, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, or any other AI assistant for development. Use AI as heavily as you like to move fast. However, you must understand every line of code you submit and be prepared to explain your implementation decisions during the evaluation interview.
Technical Stack
Frontend: Next.js (TypeScript)
Backend: Python with FastAPI / Django
Database: SQLite (design your own schema)
Note: real audio transcription is out of scope. You may seed transcript data, accept an uploaded transcript file (e.g. .txt/.vtt/.json), or optionally call an LLM to generate summaries from existing transcript text.
Core Features (Must Have)
1. Meetings Library / Dashboard
Recreate the Fireflies meetings home view.
List of past meetings with title, date, duration, and participants
Search and filter meetings (by title, date, or participant)
Sort by recency
Navbar with profile/settings placeholders
2. Meeting / Transcript Detail View
Implement the core meeting page.
Interactive transcript with speaker labels and timestamps
A media player area with a seek bar (audio/video can be a placeholder or a sample file)
Clicking a transcript line seeks the player to that timestamp (and vice versa)
Search within the transcript with highlighted matches
3. AI Summary & Notes
AI-generated meeting summary section
Action items / tasks extracted from the meeting
Key topics / outline / chapters
Summaries can be seeded, mocked, or LLM-generated from transcript text
4. Meeting Management (CRUD)
Implement CRUD for meetings and their contents.
Create a meeting (by uploading or pasting a transcript, or via a form)
Edit meeting metadata (title, participants)
Delete a meeting
Add / edit / complete action items
All meetings, transcripts, summaries, and action items must persist
5. Fireflies Experience
The application should closely resemble the Fireflies experience, including:
Navigation and layout (library + detail view)
Transcript and summary panels
Forms, modals, search, and filters
Notifications / toasts
Settings placeholders
The goal is to make the application feel like Fireflies rather than a generic notes app.
Mocked / Placeholder Sections
The following can be present as placeholders (a simple “Coming Soon” is sufficient):
Real-time bot that joins live calls
Actual speech-to-text transcription
Integrations (Zoom, Google Meet, calendar, CRM)
Team / sharing & collaboration
Real user authentication (assume a default logged-in user)
Bonus (Optional)
Comments / highlights / soundbites on transcript segments
Export transcript or summary (PDF / Markdown / TXT)
Global search across all meetings
Tags / topics and filtering by them
LLM-powered “ask a question about this meeting” chat
Dark mode
Important Notes
UI Design: your application should totally resemble Fireflies's design. Study Fireflies's UI carefully before starting.
Sample Data: seed your database. Seed several meetings with full transcripts, summaries, and action items so the app is immediately usable.
Database Design: design your own database schema. This will be evaluated.
README File: include setup instructions, tech stack used, architecture overview, database schema, and any assumptions made.
Original Work: plagiarism from existing repositories will result in immediate disqualification.
Deliverables
Source Code: a public GitHub repository containing frontend/ and backend/.
Documentation: a README with setup instructions, architecture overview, database schema, and API overview.
Demo: a hosted, working link.
Submission
Upload your code to GitHub and ensure the repository is public.
Deploy your application (Vercel, Netlify, Render, Railway, or any cloud service).
Submit both the GitHub repository link and the deployed application link.
